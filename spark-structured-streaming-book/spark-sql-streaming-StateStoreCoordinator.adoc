== [[StateStoreCoordinator]] StateStoreCoordinator -- Tracking Locations of StateStores for StateStoreRDD

`StateStoreCoordinator` keeps track of link:spark-sql-streaming-StateStore.adoc[StateStores] loaded in Spark executors (across the nodes in a Spark cluster).

The main purpose of `StateStoreCoordinator` is for `StateStoreRDD` to link:spark-sql-streaming-StateStoreRDD.adoc#getPreferredLocations[get the location preferences for partitions] (based on the location of the stores).

[[instances]]
`StateStoreCoordinator` uses `instances` internal registry of link:spark-sql-streaming-StateStoreProvider.adoc[StateStoreProviders] by their ids and `ExecutorCacheTaskLocations`.

`StateStoreCoordinator` is a `ThreadSafeRpcEndpoint` RPC endpoint that manipulates <<instances, instances>> registry through <<messages, RPC messages>>.

[width="100%",cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Message
| Message Handler

| [[DeactivateInstances]] `DeactivateInstances`
a| Removes `StateStoreProviderIds` (from <<instances, instances>>) with `queryRunId` as `runId`

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Deactivating instances related to checkpoint location [runId]: [comma-separated storeIdsToRemove]
```

| [[GetLocation]] `GetLocation`
a| Gives the location of `StateStoreProviderId` (from <<instances, instances>>) with the host and an executor id on that host.

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Got location of the state store [id]: [executorId]
```

| [[ReportActiveInstance]] `ReportActiveInstance`
a| Registers `StateStoreProviderId` that is active on an executor (given host and port).

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Reported state store [id] is active at [executorId]
```

| [[StopCoordinator]] `StopCoordinator`
a| Stops `StateStoreCoordinator` RPC Endpoint

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
INFO StateStoreCoordinator stopped
```

| [[VerifyIfInstanceActive]] `VerifyIfInstanceActive`
a| Verifies if `StateStoreProviderId` is registered (in <<instances, instances>>) on `executorId`

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Verified that state store [id] is active: [response]
```

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` or `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStoreCoordinator` to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStoreCoordinator=TRACE
```

Refer to link:spark-sql-streaming-logging.adoc[Logging].
