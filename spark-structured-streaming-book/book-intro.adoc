== Spark Structured Streaming (Apache Spark {{ book.version }})

Welcome to *Spark Structured Streaming* gitbook!

I'm https://pl.linkedin.com/in/jaceklaskowski[Jacek Laskowski], an independent consultant, developer and trainer focusing exclusively on *Apache Spark*, Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams (with Scala and sbt on Apache Mesos, Hadoop YARN and DC/OS). I offer courses, workshops, mentoring and software development services.

I lead http://www.meetup.com/WarsawScala/[Warsaw Scala Enthusiasts] and http://www.meetup.com/Warsaw-Spark[Warsaw Spark] meetups in Warsaw, Poland.

Contact me at jacek@japila.pl or https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] to discuss Apache Spark and Apache Kafka opportunities, e.g. courses, workshops, mentoring or application development services.

If you like the gitbook you should seriously consider participating in my own, very hands-on, in-depth https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-workshop/blob/gh-pages/slides/README.md#toc[Apache Spark Workshops and Webinars] and in particular brand new and shiny https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-workshop/blob/gh-pages/spark-structured-streaming-workshop.md[Spark Structured Streaming (Apache Spark 2.2) Workshop].

*Spark Structured Streaming* gitbook serves as the ultimate place of mine to collect all the nuts and bolts of using https://spark.apache.org[Spark Structured Streaming] in the most effective way. The notes aim to help me designing and developing better products with Apache Spark. It is also a viable proof of my current understanding of Apache Spark. I do eventually want to reach the highest level of mastery in Apache Spark (as do you!)

The collection of notes serves as *the study material* for my trainings, workshops, videos and courses about Apache Spark. Follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] for up to date news and to learn about the upcoming events about Apache Spark.

TIP: I'm also writing https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark[Mastering Apache Spark 2 (Spark 2.2+)] and https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/apache-kafka/[Mastering Apache Kafka (Kafka 0.11.0.0+)].
